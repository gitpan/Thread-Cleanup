NAME
    Thread::Cleanup - Hook thread destruction.

VERSION
    Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
        use Thread::Cleanup;

        use threads;

        Thread::Cleanup::register {
         my $tid = threads->tid();
         warn "Thread $tid finished\n";
        };

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to hook thread destruction without fiddling with
    the internals of threads.

    It acts globally on all the threads that may spawn anywhere in your
    program, with the exception of the main thread.

FUNCTIONS
  "register BLOCK"
    Specify that the "BLOCK" will have to be called (in void context,
    without arguments) every time a thread finishes is job. More precisely,

    *   it will always be called before the join for joined threads ;

    *   it will be called for detached threads only if they terminate before
        the main thread, and the hook will then fire at "END" time ;

    *   it won't trigger for the destruction of the main thread.

EXPORT
    None.

DEPENDENCIES
    perl 5.8.

    threads 1.07.

    XSLoader.
