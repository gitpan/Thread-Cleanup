NAME
    Thread::Cleanup - Hook thread destruction.

VERSION
    Version 0.05

SYNOPSIS
        use Thread::Cleanup;

        use threads;

        Thread::Cleanup::register {
         my $tid = threads->tid();
         warn "Thread $tid finished\n";
        };

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to hook thread destruction without fiddling with
    the internals of threads.

    It acts globally on all the threads that may spawn anywhere in your
    program, with the exception of the main thread.

FUNCTIONS
  "register"
        register { ... };
        &register($coderef);

    Specify that the given block or code reference $coderef will have to be
    called (in void context, without arguments) every time a thread finishes
    its job. More precisely,

    *   it will always be called before the joining for joined threads ;

    *   it will be called for detached threads if and only if they terminate
        before the main thread, and the hook will then fire at "END" time ;

    *   it won't trigger for the destruction of the main thread.

EXPORT
    None.

DEPENDENCIES
    perl 5.8.

    A C compiler. This module may happen to build with a C++ compiler as
    well, but don't rely on it, as no guarantee is made in this regard.

    threads 1.07.
