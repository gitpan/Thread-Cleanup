=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to hook thread destruction without fiddling with the internals of L<threads>.

It acts globally on all the threads that may spawn anywhere in your program, with the exception of the main thread.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 C<register BLOCK>

Specify that the C<BLOCK> will have to be called (in void context, without arguments) every time a thread finishes its job.
More precisely,

=over 4

=item *

it will always be called before the joining for joined threads ;

=item *

it will be called for detached threads if and only if they terminate before the main thread, and the hook will then fire at C<END> time ;

=item *

it won't trigger for the destruction of the main thread.
