}

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Thread::Cleanup;

    use threads;

    Thread::Cleanup::register {
     my $tid = threads->tid();
     warn "Thread $tid finished\n";
    };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to hook thread destruction without fiddling with the internals of L<threads>.

It acts globally on all the threads that may spawn anywhere in your program, with the exception of the main thread.

The hook will also be called when pseudo-forks (i.e. processes spawn on Windows for the C<fork> emulation) terminate.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 C<register>

    register { ... };
    &register($coderef);

Specify that the given block or code reference C<$coderef> will have to be called (in void context, without arguments) every time a thread or a pseudo-fork terminates.
More precisely :

=over 4

=item *

For joined threads, it will be called when C<join> succeeds, after any C<END> block local to the spawn thread ;

=item *

For detached threads, it will be called if and only if the thread terminates before the main thread, and the hook will then fire at global C<END> time ;

=item *

For pseudo-forks, it will be called when C<waitpid> succeeds, after any C<END> block local to the spawn process but before any global C<END> block ;

=item *

It will never trigger for the destruction of the main thread.
